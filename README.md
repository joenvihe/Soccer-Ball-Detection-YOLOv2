# Soccer Ball Detection using YOLOv2 (Darkflow)

<img src="./sample_result2.PNG"/>

## Introduction
This notebook shows how object detection can be done on your own dataset by training YOLOv2. I am going to use soccer playing images as training dataset as an example to detect soccer ball. After finishing this notebook, you will be able to train your own model, and detect objects that you are interested in.

## Contents
1. How to prepare your own dataset
2. How to make your own configuration file
3. How to define options for training for your own dataset
4. How to load from checkpoint
5. How to make a prediction
